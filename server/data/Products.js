        "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",

        "Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?  C++ Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?  C++ Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?  C++ Why you should learn C++ Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow. There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems! Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++. Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.",

        "This course is for the new Arduino Maker. Do you have a passion for learning? Are you excited about becoming a Maker with the Arduino? If you answered yes! to both, then you are ready to get started! In making this course, I emphasized the importance of getting the basics right and learning to mastery. As an educator for over 15 years, I know first-hand that hitting a roadblock because you lack the fundamental knowledge to progress can be demotivating. In Arduino Step by Step Getting Started, I make sure that in the more than 16 hours of video content, mini projects and quizzes, we cover all the basics so that you can enjoy learning about the Arduino.",

        "Join this bestselling Docker & Kubernetes course and learn two of the most important development technologies from the ground up, in great detail! Docker & Kubernetes are amongst the most in-demand technologies and topics you can learn these days. Why? Because they significantly simplify the development and deployment process of both simple and complex software projects. Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really take you to the next level! With Docker, you create and manage so-called Containers - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a predictable, environment-independent way - no matter where you need to run it. For modern DevOps but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a winner feature since you will no longer have any but it worked on my machine discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!",

        "This course is fully up-to-date with React 18 (the latest version of React)! It was completely updated and re-recorded from the ground up - it teaches the very latest version of React with all the core, modern features you need to know! This course also comes with two paths which you can take: The complete path (full >40h course) and the summary path (~4h summary module) - you can choose the path that best fits your time requirements! :-) React.js is THE most popular JavaScript library you can use and learn these days to build modern, reactive user interfaces for the web. This course teaches you React in-depth, from the ground up, step by step by diving into all the core basics, exploring tons of examples and also introducing you to advanced concepts as well. You'll get all the theory, tons of examples and demos, assignments and exercises and tons of important knowledge that is skipped by most other resources - after all, there is a reason why this course is that huge! :) And in case you don't even know why you would want to learn React and you're just here because of some ad or the algorithm - no worries: ReactJS is a key technology as a web developer and in this course I will also explain WHY it's that important!",
